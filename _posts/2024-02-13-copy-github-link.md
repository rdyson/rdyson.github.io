In VS Code, I often want to share a Github link to a specific line with teammates. The [Github Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension lets you right-click on a line and copy a Github link to the line in the current commit or on head.

The built in "Copy vscode.dev Link", which is also accessible by right-clicking on a line, is handy too, especially if you want to make a quick change to a file, but might not be as useful as a Github link.
